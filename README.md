# Malware Classification Project

**Learning by doing!!**  
This is my attempt to get a feel of static Malware Analysis and Classification by participating in an old [Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification) on Malware Classification organised by Microsoft. I have followed the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283986464_Novel_Feature_Extraction_Selection_and_Fusion_for_Effective_Malware_Family_Classification) by Mansour Ahmadi et al. as reference for the project.

The project was done under the guidance of Prof. KK Shukla, CSE Department, IIT (BHU) Varanasi.
